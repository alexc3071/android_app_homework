# Android App
This project is an assignment for a web technologies class. In this assignment I developed an android application based on the theme of movies using Android Studio. The app was developed to meet a set of functional specifications, which included things such as:

  * Displaying popular movies and tv shows
  * Querying the movie database for items using standard search functionality
  * Getting additional details for movies and shows, including cast, reviews, trailers, related media
  * Links for sharing on social media or accessing related sites
  * Saving, editing, and displaying favorited media items
  * etc.

The backend of the app, which is located in a different repository, was developed using NodeJS and Express. The backend server was temporarily hosted on a Google Cloud server for the duration of the app runtime.
